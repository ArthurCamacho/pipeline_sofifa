Dad and son sat on a bench in a subway station
They didn't have a place to stay
Then, the kid say the machine isn't a time machine
So daddy beggin made a story
Next he said they were caevemen
and there were dinosaurs around they
Dad said "becareful"
Finally, they went to look for a cave to be safe
Then they locked themselves in the water closet
And enven someone knocked in the door, they donÂ´t open it, and spent the night there
